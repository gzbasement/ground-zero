Ground Zero is comprised completely of students. If you've ever complained about being bored or not being able to meet people, then GZ may be your chance to try something a little different.


Want to give your input and help out at events? Consider joining GZ. Come to an event and talk to a member! Or you can attend our weekly general meetings which take place on the third floor of the Student Union 3510/3511 every Sunday at 8pm.
