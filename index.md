## About

Ground Zero is a student-run music club at [RPI](http://rpi.edu/) in Troy, NY. We run a music and arts space in [2 Edgehill Terrace EC4](https://goo.gl/maps/TicP5Nam3wT1xrmH8), where we hold bi-monthly open mics and other events throughout the school year.

The venue is handicap-accessible and a safe(r) space!
